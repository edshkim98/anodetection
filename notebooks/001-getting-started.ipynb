    "[Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib): Anomalib is a deep learning library that aims to collect state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms for benchmarking on both public and private datasets. Anomalib provides several ready-to-use implementations of anomaly detection algorithms described in the recent literature, as well as a set of tools that facilitate the development and implementation of custom models. The library has a strong focus on image-based anomaly detection, where the goal of the algorithm is to identify anomalous images, or anomalous pixel regions within images in a dataset.\n",

In this notebook, we will explore `anomalib` with `MVTec AD` dataset. "

Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects. It's uploaded in kaggle platform, [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipythonx/mvtec-ad). And now, we can use from kaggle environment. \n",
